Congratulations on deciding to enter the exciting world of iOS development and welcome to Make School! =]

In this tutorial we will be making a note taking app called Make School Notes. The tutorial is broken down into bite sized pieces called modules and each module implements one piece of Make School Notes. After completing all modules you will have a fully functioning note taking app that is capable of adding, editing, and deleting notes!
