Welcome to bonus stage, your mission should you accept, is to work through the list of challenges and take your app to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students, it's good to collaborate and often results in new and exciting directions.

If you have any challenge suggestions, we would love to hear them.  Please provide feedback at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/MakeSchoolNotes-Swift-V2).

It would be a good idea to make sure you have used _Git_ to commit a working version before starting these challenges.

# Add some color!

> [challenge]
> Remember how we added color to our app in Tip Calculator? Try to do the same with your Notes app!

# Improve the ordering of notes

> [challenge]
> Currently, our notes are displayed in order of creation (oldest at the top). Try reversing the display so the newest notes are displayed at the top!

# Add a preview of the note's contents

> [challenge]
> Can you modify the note cell to add a truncated version of the note's content? See the Apple Notes app to see how their UI looks!
