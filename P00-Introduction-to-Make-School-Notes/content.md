# Welcome

Welcome to the Make School Notes tutorial series and congratulations on taking the first step to building your very own iOS app!

This series was designed for beginning iOS developer and will teach you the fundamentals of iOS application development. After finishing this series, you will have built a fully functional note taking app and will be well prepared to start the advanced tutorial, Makestagram.

This tutorial has been divided into three parts:

1. In the first part, we will focus on building the **interface** of our app. You will learn how to:

* Use and setup table views to display lists of information
* Create custom table view cells in Interface Builder
* Use and create new view controllers
* Setup navigation controllers
* Use and setup segues to transition between view controllers
* Use and create bar button items

2. The second part is devoted to programming our apps **logic**. You will learn how to:

* Create appropriate data models
* Pass data between view controllers
* Program the functionality to add, display, modify, and delete notes
* Connect our interface to our logic

3. In the third and final part we will focus on **persisting data** between app launches. You will learn how to:

* Locally store information using the Realm framework
* Create static helper methods
* Modify existing code to integrate data persistence

## Getting Started

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you the fundamentals of iOS development, not to confuse you with how to setup and structure a new project in Xcode. For this reason, we have provided a starter project that includes the necessary libraries and some files that have already been properly structured. This will allow us to get started quickly, and most importantly, ensure that nobody gets discouraged by errors from setting up the project incorrectly.
